## FAQ

### What licenses do I need to run this solution?
The solution in this app uses Office connectors, therefore a seeded Power Apps license from Office is sufficient to run and play the user and admin apps. More information: Power Platform licensing overview. If you want to use the Power BI report (packaged as part of the solution), you'll need a Power BI license. More information: Power BI pricing
